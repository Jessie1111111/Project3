    <p class="word t1">A riot is going to happen at 3am tomorrow. The opponent is the largest underground group "SNA" in the western fifth district. Tomorrow, they will have around 100 people entering the center of Times Square through an underground warehouse, bypassing the patrols of the mercenaries, attempting to carry out destructive actions such as explosions. Your working hours tomorrow are from 2am to 4am. Please try to capture their leader "Ran". Please stay alive.
