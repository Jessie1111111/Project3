  <p class="word t1"> It has been 4 years and 3 months since the virus outbreak. We do not deny the existence of the virus four years ago, but now the virus has long since disappeared. Do you know why during curfew, the government requires everyone to close their doors and windows and organize air circulation? Do you know why during the day, each person can only have a fixed amount of breaths? It's because the air quality on earth has dropped to a level where oxygen is being lost in large amounts. The government can only compress the breathing time and amount of ordinary citizens to provide more time for those in higher classes. Nowadays, they have already found a way to extend their lifespan, but they need to ensure that there is enough oxygen in the world for them to survive.
