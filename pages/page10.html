        <p class="word t1">Ran is the head commander of this riot. He has short brown crew cut hair, two knife scars under his eyes, and a sturdy and muscular build. However, his left leg was injured and he moves with difficulty due to a previous encounter with the mercenaries. Please try your best to capture Ran. If you succeed in capturing him, please immediately kill him and retrieve the B162 secret chip he carries on his person.
