    <p class="word t1">Your name is R and you come from the year 2023. You were originally an ordinary white-collar worker who died in a car accident and was transported to the year 2150. Your body's original owner was a 19-year-old boy who was a regular mercenary patrolling during curfew hours. In a riot, he unfortunately contracted a virus and died. You wake up exactly one day before the riot occurred. You need to learn the knowledge and skills required to be a mercenary within 24 hours and ensure that you survive in the upcoming turmoil.
