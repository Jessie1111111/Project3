        <p class="word t1">This is the year 2150. It is an era of peace, and the world has achieved unity, with the global republic being referred to as the new name for Earth. Technology is rapidly advancing, and various high-intelligence AI products are integrated into every aspect of life. Each person here has a fixed number from birth and is assigned a fixed job that cannot be changed. Now in the year 2150, it is an era of virus spread, and this virus spreads faster at night. Therefore, the republic has decided to impose a curfew from 8 pm to 6 am, and anyone who violates the rules will receive severe punishment. During the daytime, there are strict limitations on the time and amount of respiratory exposure for citizens to prevent viral infections when they go out for activities. It has been four years and three months since the last global virus outbreak. The country has not taken any other effective measures except for the curfew, which has caused dissatisfaction among citizens around the world. Currently, in the Western Zone Five, there are frequent riots during curfew hours.
